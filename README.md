# Anvil
A web framework built on top of Vertx that focuses on building to api contracts. 

Anvil is intended to be used in conjunction with a Smithy API Specification.

  - [ ] Abstract operation definitions
  - [ ] Java Vert.x Router generator
  - [ ] Java vert.x Route validator generator
- [ ] API Exception mapping (? possibly in a different package?)
